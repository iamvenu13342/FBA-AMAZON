🎥 **Short Script – Amazon FBA in a Nutshell**

Amazon FBA is one of the best ways to build passive income.
There are 3 main ways to make money with it:

1️⃣ **Arbitrage** – Buy branded products cheap, resell higher.
2️⃣ **Wholesale** – Buy in bulk from existing brands and sell.
3️⃣ **Private Label** – Create your own product. This is the most profitable.

👉 Here’s the simple process:

* **Step 1**: Find a product with high demand and low competition.
* **Step 2**: Improve it — make a better version.
* **Step 3**: Source it from a reliable supplier (China, India, U.S., anywhere).
* **Step 4**: Send it to Amazon’s warehouse.
* **Step 5**: Launch it, get seen by customers, and start selling on autopilot.

Repeat the process with new products to grow your income 💰.

That’s Amazon FBA simplified 🚀.
