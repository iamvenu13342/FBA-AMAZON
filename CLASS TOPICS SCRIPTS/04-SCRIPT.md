# 🎥 Amazon FBA Costs & Fees

Before starting Amazon FBA, it’s important to know the **real costs**.

✅ Starting a physical business like a restaurant or franchise can cost **hundreds of thousands**.
But with Amazon FBA, the startup cost is much lower.

👉 On average, expect **\$7,000–\$9,000** to launch a private label product.

* **Low end**: \~\$5,000
* **High end**: \~\$12,000

Anyone saying you can start with just a few hundred dollars for private label is misleading. That only applies to retail/online arbitrage — not building your own brand.

💡 Here’s where the money goes:

1. **Product Research** – tools, testing, patents (\~\$200).
2. **Business Setup** – logo, LLC, Seller Central fees.
3. **Production** – manufacturing, packaging, inspection, samples.
4. **Shipping** – getting products to Amazon’s warehouses.
5. **Listing Creation** – images, keywords, copywriting.
6. **Launch** – PPC ads, coupons, reviews.
7. **Reorders** – plan ahead so you don’t sell out and lose ranking.

⚠️ Remember: FBA is not a quick side hustle. It’s a **real business**. You need either time, money, or both to see real cash flow.
